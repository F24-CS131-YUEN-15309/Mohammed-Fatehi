This presentation gives an overview of quantum computing, explaining its basic ideas like superposition and entanglement, and how it differs from classical computing. It covers the role of qubits, quantum algorithms, and the challenges of dealing with errors and decoherence. You'll also learn about how quantum computing could impact cryptography and the idea of quantum supremacy. While the technology is still in the experimental stage, the presentation looks at its future potential and applications.
